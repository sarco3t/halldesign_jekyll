  subtitle: The Main Idea of Our Company
  title: YOU = ART
  description: "At the top of every masterpiece stands an artist, every grand structure was once commissioned by a client and executed by a craftsman. Human creates and progresses art. Human moves it, pressing the buttons deemed necessary. So, art should not be evaluated separately from the person, as it is a reflection in the mirror."
  steps:
    step1:
      title: HOW DOES IT REFLECT IN INTERIOR?
      description: "By placing the individual at the center of art as an art object, we strive to recreate your mood in space to the maximum. To push you towards the best version of yourself. To help you know and love yourself, understand yourself. Our values are shaped by the emotional and psychological perception of space by our clients. We want to make a person's stay in space as comfortable as possible, and for this, we constantly study you, ask a million questions, like interior psychologists."
    step2:
      title: OUR IDEAL
      description: "Our direct ideal is the personalization of space without budget constraints. We believe that it is not the price that forms the uniqueness of the product, but its value. Therefore, regardless of your budget, we design interiors where you feel comfortable, emotional, calm, and joyful, and everything else that reflects your personality."

    title: FOUNDED
    description: Self-discovery and purpose
    bottom_text: "Our first steps did not always bring the expected result. But perseverance and a systematic approach to work are our main traits. Therefore, success awaited us in the future."
    text: "<p>Finishing the 4th year of university, young and inspired by my works at the Synthesis of Arts exhibition, I decided to create my own company. Thinking about the name, I knew for sure that it had to be something that conveyed a sense of celebration, welcome, good intentions, and restraint. So the name HALL came naturally - a place that always greets us and is the first impression of a space, becoming its highlight and emotion.</p>
  <p>
  Of course, the first year was the most difficult in our career. We established our path, developed our traditions, got to know our clients and ourselves. We refined our project to meet the standards demanded by the market, not just GOST.

    title: FIRST STEPS
    description: Creating our own path
    bottom_text: "We got everything we could from this stage, and maybe even a bit more. Grateful for each day - it was a happy time in our lives, full of various emotions."
    text: >-
      After the initial attempts and mistakes, we realized that staying in the shadows and gradually building up our experience was not for us. We wanted to make a statement, to be seen by people every day. So we decided to move to a shopping center to be visible to thousands of people every day. We learned communication, creativity, and sincerity even while being on display every day.

      During this time we:
        4. Changed 4 employees in our team;
        5. Created 156 amazing projects;
        6. Went through 2 quarantines and a full-scale invasion;
        7. Doubled our team;
        8. Took on our first international projects;

      This office was our home, without which I couldn't imagine a single day.

    title: PRESENT DAY
    description: Creative work flow
    top_text: "As our team grew larger, the 20m² space became cramped. Therefore, at the end of 2023, the decision was made to move to a larger office located in the industrial heart of Khmelnytskyi - IQ CENTER."
    text: "Now we feel like a creative family. We create various projects - interiors, exteriors, landscapes, architecture, product modeling, and technical projects. We have learned to listen to you and your wishes - that's why we offer super-fast projects in 2 weeks and projects that only include engineering plans. We have many service packages and means of communication. We prioritize comfort, convenience, and ease because renovation can often be stressful, so we are here to make this process easier for you and answer all your questions."
    bottom_text: "Our story is written every day. Each day is different, just like us, just like you. But together - we make this world unbelievably beautiful. With love, your HALL DESIGN"
